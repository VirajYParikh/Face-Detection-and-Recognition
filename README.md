# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
Basic Implementation of Face Detection and Facial Recognition along with some use of Facial Landmarks

Being a curious tech buff as I am, I was very drawn to Computer Vision and the various applications it has. I came across a very interesting Python library: OpenCV

This package has several use cases one of them being FacialRecognition.

Id like to explain the steps that I undertook while working on this project.
